I have a {current_difficulty} level web development project that I want to enhance to {target_difficulty.value} difficulty level.

Original Project Details:

Title: {project_data["title"]}

Description: {project_data["description"]}

Project Type: {project_type} (Frontend, Backend, or Full-Stack)

Tech Stack: {', '.join(project_data["tech_stack"])}

Enhancement Instructions:

Feature Expansion:
- Improve upon existing features instead of replacing them.
- Introduce additional web-focused features that complement the existing ones.

Tech Stack Evolution:
- CRITICAL: Ensure the tech stack is appropriate for the project type:
  * For FRONTEND projects: Only include frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, etc.), CSS frameworks, and related technologies.
  * For BACKEND projects: Only include backend frameworks (Express, Django, Flask, etc.), databases, and server technologies. DO NOT include frontend frameworks like React.
  * For FULLSTACK projects: Include an appropriate mix of frontend and backend technologies.

- Provide a diverse and varied tech stack that suits the project requirements.
- Be creative and consider many different tech stack combinations (don't default to the same few technologies).
- Consider popular stacks appropriate for the project type, such as:
  * For frontend: React/Next.js, Vue/Nuxt.js, Angular, Svelte/SvelteKit
  * For backend: Express/Node.js, Django/Python, Ruby on Rails, FastAPI, Spring Boot
  * For fullstack: MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js), MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js), FARM (FastAPI, React, MongoDB), LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)

- IMPORTANT: Only include frameworks, programming languages, and databases in the tech stack. DO NOT include individual libraries or packages (like Axios, NumPy, or SQLite).
- IMPORTANT: Avoid redundancy in the tech stack. For example, if you include Next.js, do not also include React since Next.js is built on React. Similarly, if you include Django, don't also list Python separately.
- For example, good tech stack items are: React OR Next.js (not both), Node.js, PostgreSQL, Django (implies Python), MongoDB, Vue.js, Ruby on Rails, FastAPI, etc.
- When replacing a technology with a more advanced alternative (like React â†’ Next.js), remove the original technology from the list.
- Explain why the new technologies improve performance, scalability, or security.

Web Development Best Practices:
- Ensure performance optimization techniques are applied.
- Suggest improvements for accessibility (a11y) and responsive design.
- Follow security best practices (e.g., CSRF protection, OAuth, etc.).

Difficulty-Specific Guidelines:
    """
    
    if target_difficulty == DifficultyLevel.INTERMEDIATE:
        prompt += """
For Intermediate Level Enhancements:
- Introduce 2-3 additional features to improve user experience (e.g., better UI state management, animations, real-time updates).
- Implement authentication and authorization using JWT or OAuth.
- Suggest database integration (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.) if missing.
- Optimize API performance with caching (Redis) or pagination.
        """
    elif target_difficulty == DifficultyLevel.ADVANCED:
        prompt += """
For Advanced Level Enhancements:
- Introduce 4-5 high-complexity features (e.g., multi-user roles, dynamic permissions, background jobs, AI-powered recommendations).
- Implement full authentication and role-based access control (RBAC).
- Use advanced state management (Redux Toolkit, Zustand, TanStack Query).
- Suggest microservices, GraphQL, or WebSockets for scalability.
- Improve security (e.g., rate limiting, encryption, OAuth2 flows).
- Include DevOps considerations like CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker), and cloud deployment strategies.
